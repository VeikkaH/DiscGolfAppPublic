# DiscGolfAppPublic

### This is a Disc Golf App (name TBD) used to track scores from played rounds and search for Disc Golf courses in Finland (more countries to be added).

*This repository is used to showcase the app's features and development progress publically while the source code is in a private repository due to the application being released commercially in the future. 
Source code examples can be provided upon request at HupanenVeikka@gmail.com*
